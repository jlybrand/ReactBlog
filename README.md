- [] Bootstrap site
- []  When a user registers they should be able to enter text for their "About Me" section, upload a profile photo, and add links to their social media accounts in addition to the existing functionality.
  - Only social media accounts to which a user provide a link should appear in their "About Me" section". 

- [] When I click a post from the homepage it should render the single post with the author's 'About Me' section rendered in the side bar. This section should include the text about the author and associated social links and contact info. How to link the author of the story to their pic in public folder???
  - Should read "Follow Me" instead of "Follow Us".
  - Should the categories section also be rendered?
